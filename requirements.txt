#Getting Started
##1.Installation process:The PDDL extension for VScode was installed through the VScode extensions marketplace.
                 It was used to program and run the files
##2.Software dependencies: The grid_domain.pddl and planningTestCase#.pddl are both needed to run. 
planningCreator.pddl is not needed to run the program but is used to create the planningTestCase#.pddl files
## PDDL 2.28.2 and Python 3.13.2 were used to run the code.

#Build and Test
To run (in VS code) go to the planningTestCase#.pddl file you want, press Alt + P, 
then select LAMA-first to run the plan. The output would be the actions it used to 
create the plan. To visualize the finished grid, we drew what squares were used in each action

#Contribute
Nicole Hernandez and Dylan Letts code the project together. The way we coded was often to 
discuss how we wanted to implement features together- brainstorming logic faster. Then we 
took turns coding on the same computer so we both understood the code and could help each 
other ensure correctness.
